*** We created a NASA CLI that gives you 3 options to choose from.
When prompted, you will select 1, 2, or 3.
1 will bring you to a live feed of the International Space Station.
2. Will give you another prompt to enter a date in YYYY-MM-DD format to get the NASA Picture of the Day for that given date.
3. This will give you random information on an Asteroid in NASA's database.
